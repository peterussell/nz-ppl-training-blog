# The Altimeter

 * Mean Sea Level (MSL) is the average height of the sea surface calculated from hourly
   tide readings taken over many years.
 * The altimeter compares **static pressure** of the aircraft to a height in the
   International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

**Standard Pressure**

ISA Standard Pressure at mean sea level (MSL) is **1013.2 hectopascals (hPA).** For
day-to-day operations we use 1013 hPa.

**Atmospheric pressure reduced by approximately 1 hPa for each 30' gain an altitude,
up to about 5,000'.**

The altimeter converts this reduction in atmospheric pressure to a gain in altitude.
eg. if the pressure falls by 15 hPa, that means we've gained 450' (15 hPa x 30' per hPa).

# How the Altimeter Works

 * Contains a sealed, expandable, aneroid capsule inside a sealed instrument case, which
   is connected to the static vent.
 * As the aircraft climbs, static pressure around the capsule decreases and the capsule
   expands, converted into a climb on the altimeter.
 * There are three pointers on most altimeters: longest = hundreds of feet, middle = 
   thousands, shortest = tens of thousands.
 * *To further emphasise you're **below 10,000'*** there's a **striped sector**. This
   slowly decreases in size as height is gained, and at 10,000' will have disappeared.
 * Atmospheric pressure varies between places nad times as weather patterns move
   across the country. The actual pressure may vary greatly from standard pressure,
   meaning we must have a way to set the appropriate pressure setting.

**Altimeter Subscale Settings**

 * Can set a range of pressure values on a **subscale** via a rotatable knob. The
   altimeter displays the height above whatever's been set on the subscale.

**In New Zealand, operations below 13,000' AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level) are conducted
with reference to MSL, so MSL pressure is always set on the subscale.** This pressure
setting is referred to as "the **QNH**".

**Difference between height and altitude** - with QNH set, we refer to the reading on
the altimeter as altitude.

 * The advantage to flying with QNH set is we know our clearance above the ground, etc.
   because these are **all on charts in MSL**.
 * For **local operations** at or near an aerodrome, the 'local QNH' is set on the
   subscale prior to takeoff. The altimeter reading should be close to aerodrome
   elevation.
 * At **controlled aerodromes**, local QNH is available from ATIS (Automatic Terminal
   Information Service) if installed, otherwise from the tower.
 * At **uncontrolled aerodromes**, *Flight Service* may have the QNH for your
   aerodrome, or simply set the aerodrome elevation while on the ground.

**Other Subscale Settings**

 * QFE - any given datum *other than MSL*. When QFE is set, altimeter reads a given
   distance (height) above the datum selected. Not commonly used in New Zealand.
 * QNE - **pressure altitude** - what the altimeter reads when set to 1013.2 hPa.
   **QNE is used for all flights above 15,000' in New Zealand, referred to as
   *flight levels*.

# Subscale Setting Errors

 * If the subscale setting accurately reflects local pressure, then the reading will
   accurately indicate MSL. Otherwise, it will read higher or lower than the aircraft
   actually is.
 * QNH usually changes gradually throughout the day, and from place to place. Sometimes
   these can be quite rapid, eg. passage of a vigorous front.
 * **Changes of 1 hPa or more are advised by Air Traffic Control, FLight Service, or
   on ATIS** at appropriate times.
 * If, for some reason the pilot is unable to obtain an amended QNH, the errors
   in altitude are:

Flying from high pressure to low pressure, altitmeter reads high:

 * **hi - lo - hi**

Flying from low pressure to high pressure, altimeter reads low:

 * **lo - hi -lo**

Having a *higher* reading means you are *lower* than you think you are (and vice versa).

# Altimeter Errors

Assuming the subscale has been set, there are other (usually minor) errors:

 * **Instrument Error** - small imperfections from manufacture, installation,
   maintenance, and age.
 * **Instrument Lag** - may take a second or two to respond to rapid pressure changes.
 * **Position error** - due to placement of the static vent, usually in a skid or
   slip.
