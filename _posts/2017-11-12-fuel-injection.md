# Fuel Injection Systems

Fuel injection systems *replace* a carburettor. There are two types:

 * **Indirect Injection:** fuel is injected and mixed with the airflow somewhere
   in the inlet manifoled, *before* the inlet valve. Most common.
 * **Direct Injection:** fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber
   of each cylinder at much higher pressure. Less common, but starting to be used
   in automotive applications. They offer better fuel efficiency over indirect
   injection systems, but because the timing must be ultra-precise, and the
   injection made at high pressure, they're more expensive and heavier.
    * *NB. direct injection is used on almost all **diesel** engines, including
      on aircraft.*

**Continuous Flow Fuel Injection**

 * The most common type of indirect injection system for GA aircraft.
 * A **throttle valve** controls the amount of air going to the engine, and
   therefore the amount of power it develops.
 * A **fuel control unit (FCU)** is used to sense the *mass of air* going into
   the engine and the position of *throttle* and *mixture* controls, and varies
   the output pressure of the injection pump.
 * This metered fuel passes through a **flow divider** (or splitter) and then
   through individual lines to the **injection nozzles** associated with
   individual cylinders.
 * Fuel is injected continuously into the airflow, normally in the intake
   manifold just upstream of the inlet valve. This provides each cylinder with
   a chemically correct mixture.

**Icing**

Fuel injection systems don't suffer from refrigeration ice, suffer less
from throttle ice, and have *alternate air* to be used in case of impact ice.

**Advantages**

 * No refrigeration ice.
 * More uniform delivery of fuel-air mixture to each cylinder.
 * Improved control of fuel-air ratio.
 * Fewer maintenance problems.
 * Better throttle response.
 * Increased engine efficiency.

**Disadvantages**

 * Vapour locking in fuel lines may make re-starting a hot engine difficult.
   Electric boost pumps that pressurize the fuel lines can help.
 * Greater susceptibility to contamination in the fuel - injection systems
   have very fine fuel lines.
 * Greater awareness of fuel distribution. Surplus fuel from the pump returns
   to *one* tank, possibly causing an imbalance or resulting in it being
   vented overboard.

# The Exhaust System

 * The **exhaust manifold** is a series of steel tubes connected to the
   exhaust port of each cylinder, usually joined as a common pipe leading
   to the exhaust outlet.
 * Combustion results in a number of gases, including *carbon monoxide (CO),
   very toxic even in small concentrations. It can affect judgement and lead
   to unconsciousness or death.
 * It's possible for exhaust gases to leak into the cabin, especially if
   using cabin heat, which often runs through a muff (sleeve) around the
   exhaust manifold.
 * CO is odourless and colourless. It is compulsory to fit CO indicators in
   all cabins with an exhaust manifold heater, or heater using combustion.
 * During preflight, check the expiry date and state of the CO indicator.
