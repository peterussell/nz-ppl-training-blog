# Main Controls

Elevator, ailerons (yoke-controlled) and rudder (pedal-controlled) are the
main flight control surfaces. In typical light aircraft the surfaces are
operated by a system of cables, pulleys, and bell cranks connected to the
control inputs. **Stops** are usually fitted to physically limit movement.

# Undercarriage

May be either tricycle (nosewheel) or tailwheel (conventional). Most tricycle
aircraft have nosewheel steering. Most aeroplanes have main wheel brakes,
normally disc brakes fitted to each main wheel, controlled by the upper
rudder pedal, operated independently (differential braking). Advanced aircraft
often have retractable undercarriage, most training aircraft have fixed
undercarriage.

**Taxiing**

 * Recommended at a fast walking pace.
 * In most GA aircraft (particularly nosewheel), propellor tips are close
   to the ground, so use caution with dips and cross line depressions
   (eg. drainage ditches) at an oblique angle to avoid prop strike.
 * Tailwheel visibility can be restricted, requiring weaving during taxi.
   Also inherently unstable, so avoid large swings which may result in
   loss of directional control (ground loop).
 * Some older tailwheel aircraft are fitted with a **tailskid**, less
   prone to ground looping, but *may not be fitted with brakes*. For
   this reason (and for less wear), generally prefer to operate tailskid
   aircraft on grass.
