# Fundamental Principle of Operation

Gas turbine engines work on Newton's Third Law: for every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

If a mass of fluid (gas or liquid) is accelerated and made to flow as a gas in a
given direction, a reactive force acts in the opposite direction on the body
producing the jet (eg. the engine/wing/aeroplane).

The amount of reactive **thrust** in a jet is proportional to the mass being moved,
and the square of its velocity at the exit point from the nozzle.

Because the density of air (mass per unit volume) is relatively low, to produce
large amounts of thrust the engine must accelerate compartively large amounts of
air at high speed through a jet nozzle.

# Basic Components

 * **Engine Casing**: looks like an elongated barrel with an opening at both ends.
 * **Compressor**
 * **Turbine**: attached to the *compressor* by a shaft. The compressor/turbine is
   called a **spool**. The spool is mounted within the casing and free to rotate.
 * **Combustion Chamber**: together with **fuel injection nozzles** situated
   between the compressor and turbine.

# Operating Principle

The **compressor** can be considered a type of fan. There are commonly two types:
*centrifugal* and *axial*

 * **Centrifugal compressor** - collects air with its blades and flings it outward
   under centrifugal force to its periphery where it becomes compressed. This
   compressed air is then ducted to the combustion chamber(s). Smaller engines
   typically have one centrifugal compressor disc, larger engines may have two or
   more mounted behind each other.
 * **Axial compressor** - typically consists of a series of coupled discs, each
   with a number of blades at the periphery. Each disc is called a **stage**,
   numbered from the front (by convention). Air is compressed *progressively*
   (stage by stage) along the axis of rotation.
    * Fixed **stator blades** are mounted between each stage to straighten and
      control the airflow as it moves rearward.
    * Axial compressors in smaller jet engines typically have 5-6 stages, larger
      engines have 12+.
 * Some engines may use **both** centrifugal and axial type compressors.

**General Operation**

 * Air is drawn through the intake, compressed, and ducted into **combustion
   chambers**.
 * Fuel is sprayed into the chambers through **injection nozzles**. Fuel is
   usually a type of kerosene called Aviation Turbine Fuel (AVTUR).
 * High energy electric igniters are used during start-up to ignite the fuel-air
   mixture, but once the engine is up to normal operating speed, temperatures
   are high enough to immediately vaporize the injected fuel and spontaneously
   ignite the mixture.
 * As the mixture burns its temperature rises sharply. The gases expand and rush
   out through the exhaust nozzle as a high speed jet.
 * This flows through the **turbine** which powers the compressor, hence the
   process continues as long as the fuel and air are available for combustion.
 * Some kinetic energy is absorbed by the turbine, but the greater proportion of it
   is available to produce forward thrust.
 * On some engines, two spools will be mounted concentrically; the first compressor
   stage(s) are driven by the second turbine at a slower speed than the inner spool.

**Rating**

 * So-called *pure-jet* aircraft engines are power-rated by **maximum amount of
   thrust they can produce,** measured in pounds.
 * Smaller jet engines typically produce ~2,000 lbs of thrust.
 * Larger jet engjines (eg. modern commercial airliners) are capable of 50,000 lbs
   maximum thrust.

# Turbo-prop and Helicopter Jet Engines

 * Pure-jet engines produce thrust most efficiently at high speeds (eg. > 300kts),
   but not so efficiently at lower speeds. The converse applies to propellor-driven
   aircraft, propellor effiency drops off markedly at high speeds.
 * Therefore, pure-jet and propellor-driven aircraft have their own applications.
 * **Turbo-prop** engines are the **combination of high power/weight ratio turbine
   engines with efficiency of propellor engines in lower speed ranges**.
 * These also apply to the turbo-prop's close relation, the helicopter jet engine.
 * The principle is basically the same as a turbojet, except the **turbine/compressor
   spool has a shaft which transmits most of the power to a propellor through a
   reduction gearbox.**
 * The turbine is engineered so it **absorbs most of the energy** from the jet of
   hot gases passing through it.
 * In the turbo-prop arrangement, **about 80% of thrust comes from the propellor,
   and about 20% from the exhaust jet.**
 * Compared to the jet engine, turbo-props produce thrust more efficiently (ie. with
   better fuel economy) at the lower speed range, so are usually used for slower-
   speed, short haul routes.
 * Turbine engines in **helicopters** have a similar arrangement, but the power
   output from the turbine is 'turned' through 90 degrees by a gearbox which drives
   the vertical main rotor shaft at a much reduced RPM.
