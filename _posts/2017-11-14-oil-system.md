# Design of a Typical Oil System

 * Oil accumulates in the **sump**, a reservoir attached to the lower part of the
   engine casing.
    * A **wet sump** does not have a separate storage tank, oil is stored in the
      sump when not circulating. Most light aircraft engines are wet sump,
      with *exceptions of radial engines and aerobatic engines*.
    * A **dry sump** has a separate oil storage tank. One or more pumps are used
      to *scavenge* oil from where it collects at the sump (or sumps) and pump
      it back to the oil tank.

**Dry Sump System** (wet sump is similar without oil tank & scavenger pump)

 * Two engine-driven gear-type **oil pumps**:
    * Scavenge pump lifts the oil from the sump to the storage tank.
    * Main pump to pump fuel under pressure to the engine (only this is required
      in a wet sump system).
 * **Oil pressure relief valve** on the *engine side of the main pump*. When
   oil pressure reaches a pre-determined limit, the valve (usually spring-loaded)
   will open and divert oil back to the pump inlet.
 * **Oil pressure gauge** in the cockpit indicates oil pressure provided by the
   oil pump. The **sensor** is *between the oil pump and the engine*.
 * **Oil temperature guage** measures oil temperature just before it goes into
   the engine.
 * **Screens and filters** remove solid particulates etc.
    * If the filters become so clogged they impede oil flow, a **oil-filter
      bypass valve** will open and allow unfiltered oil to bypass the filter.
      Because this isn't ideal, if during pre-flight you notice particularly
      dirty oi, bring it to the attention of maintenance.
 * **Oil cooler** - oil is directed through this as necessary, usually routed
   by a *thermally-operated valve*.
    * In a *dry sump* system, the scavenge pump passes oil through the cooler
      before going to the tank.
    * In a *wet sump* system, oil is allowed to undergo some cooling in the
      sump, and the main oil cooler will usually be *after the main pump,
      before reaching the engine.*
    * If the oil cooler becomes blocked, a **pressure bypass valve** allows
      it to be bypassed.

# Oil Changes

 * Oil must be changed due to:
    * Imperfect filtering of oil by oil filters.
    * Change in chemical composition of the oil through oxidation caused by
      **by-products of combustion**, and **water** which condenses inside the
      engine when it cools down.

# Operational Aspects

**Pre-flight Inspection**

 * Check oil cooler for obvious leaks, and cooling air passages for obstruction.
 * Oil level checked. A small consumption will be used during normal operation
   due to some being burned in cylinders, small leaks, and loss as mist through
   the oil breather.
    * Below minimum: insufficient oil to remove heat & lubricate, and less
      available in case of an oil leak.
    * Above maximum: can be forced out through seals etc. and cause enigne issues.

**Startup**

 * **Important:** make sure oil pressure registers within 30 seconds. Shut
   down if not.

# Oil System Malfunctions

Oil system faults can have a number of causes, and can be difficult to diagnose.
We'll look at possible causes of abnormal temperatures and pressures, and
courses of actin.

**Fluctuating Oil Pressure**

 * Indicates the pump is **drawing air** from the sump or tank, probably
   indicating the oil level is dangerously low. In a dry sump system it could
   be a **scavenger pump failure**.

**Low Oil Pressure**

A number of possible causes:

 * Low oil quantity: eg. lack of oil before flight, broken line, leaking tank,
   scavenger pump failure.
 * Loss of oil pressure: failure of pressure pump or pressure line between
   it and the engine. In this case the failure would be sudden and complete.
   Could also be a failure somewhere else in the pressure system, eg. failing
   main bearings, in which case the loss would be more gradual.
 * Faulty oil pressure gauge. If oil *pressure* indication fails but oil
   *temperature* remains staedy, suspect a faulty gauge.

**High Oil Pressure**

 * Most likely a **faulty pressure relief valve**.
 * Excessively high pressure could damage the system (eg. oil seal), resulting
   in a loss of oil.

**High Oil Temperature**

 * Possibly just a result of overheating engine. Take action to reduce the engine
   temperature (remove power, open cowl flaps, increase speed, etc.)
 * If **coupled with low or reducing oil pressure**, could indicate a serious
   problem with the lubrication system.

**Fluctuating Pressure, Rising Temperature**

 * Indicative of a serious problem (low oil level). Plan to land as soon as
   possible. If the engine runs out of oil it's likely to seize shortly after.

**Pressure Maintained/Falling Slowly, Rising Temperature**

 * Indicates a slow loss of oil, and can be very difficult to tell when it will
   fall to a critical level. It may be prudent to land as soon as practical.
