# Handling the Engine

 * An aero engine is more lightly built than a car engine, it has a relatively
   high power-to-weight ratio.
 * Almost always air cooled, requiring a greater awareness of engine temperature.
 * Max RPM usually between 2,400-2,700 RPM (as opposed to 6,000 RPM for a car).
   This is due to the propellor often being connected directly to the crankshaft,
   and the need to limit propellor RPM to a speed at which it can operate
   efficiently.
 * Although cars are almost never operated near maximum RPM, it's very common to
   operate at or close to max RPM, especially during takeoff. If care isn't taken,
   *it can be easy to exceed max RPM* during a power on descent.

# Starting the Engine

**Pre-Start Safety Precautions**

 * Ideally position the aeroplane over a clear hard-standing area (or firm grass
   area), positioned into the wind (preferably) with no loose objects which might
   cause damage if picked up by the slipstream. Areas to the rear and intended
   taxi path should be clear.
 * Parking brake ON, or chocked in front of wheels if no parking brake.
 * Fire extinguisher - be aware of the nearest location in case of start-up fire.
 * Propellor awareness - warn observers in the area of engine start, if anyone
   moves toward the propellor and is a threat, mixture to IDLE CUT-OFF.

**Starting a Cold Engine**

 * Priming can be a matter of judgement, depending on how cold the engine is etc.
   Consult the POH, often 2 - 6 strokes.
 * Basis for the variation in priming (more if cold, less if hot) is the **reluctance
   of fuel to vaporise as the temperature gets colder.**
 * In extreme cold - starting may be helped by turning the engine over by hand
   through 2-3 revolutions to free it up and make the starter's job easier. Make sure
   magnetos are OFF.

**Operating the Starter**

 * A point to remember - *the starter motor draws a heavy current* and can drain the
   battery, as well as possibly overheat.
 * If the motor doesn't start within 10-15 seconds, release the ignition to allow
   the starter motor to cool before attempting a restart.
 * If failing to start on a cold day, possibly due to underpriming. Try a few more
   strokes and attempt a restart.
 * **Do not pump the throttle**. If the carburettor has an accelerator pump, this
   pumps raw fuel into the throat of the carburettor, causing a **fire hazard**.
   If no accelerator pump, the starting mixture is *weakened* as more air is
   inducted, making the start even less likely.

**Starting a Hot Engine**

 * Engine may start with reduced or no priming at all. Failure to start is likely
   to be from over-priming or flooding the carburettor.

**Starting an Over-primed (Flooded) Engine**

 * The normal method of clearing a flooded engine is: move mixture to IDLE CUT-OFF,
   fully open the throttle, and turn the engine over through a few revolutions.
   Then, select mixture to FULL RICH, crack the throttle to the normal start
   position, and try starting again with no priming.
 * *If the engine starts during the 'clearing' procedure:* immediately put
   mixture to FULL RICH, and retard throttle to the starting position.

**After Start**

 * Adjust throttle and check oil pressure. It should show a rise within **30
  seconds**, possibly a little longer if very cold.
 * *If oil pressure fails to register*, shut down the engine and have the problem
   investigated.
 * Before carrying out a high-power engine run up, make sure oil temperature and
   CHT (if fitted) are in the normal (green) range.

**In Flight**

 * Open and close throttle smoothly to avoid thermal and mechanical shock, and
   stress to moving parts, as well as preventing the engine 'cutting out' due to
   a mis-match between the mixture and RPM.
 * Same slow and deliberate operation of mixture and propellor controls is
   important.
 * Be aware to conditions which lead to overheating, eg. high power, low airspeed
   climbs.
 * Also be aware of conditions which lead to overcooling, eg. low power, high
   airspeed descents. These can lead to increasing risk of carburettor icing and
   spark plug fouling with carbon and other deposits. To offset these, it's
   common practice to open the throttle periodically to warm the engine up
   for a short period (eg. at 1,000' intervals during descent), while raising
   the nose to control airspeed.
 * Engines with cowl flaps usually also have a CHT gauge, allowing you to monitor
   and control engine heating and cooling more effectively.

**Stopping the Engine**

 * A brief run-down period at 1,000 RPM is recommended to allow engine temperature
   to stabilise and promote *even cooling*.
 * Normally shut down from low RPM (about 1,000 RPM), by pulling mixture to
   IDLE CUT-OFF, **allowing the induction system to be purged of fuel mixture**,
   leaving the engine less liable to fire accidentally if the propellor is moved
   while parked.
 * As the RPM dies down, close the throttle and switch ignition to OFF after the
   engine stops.
 * Aeroplane is usually left with throttle closed, mixture in IDLE CUT-OFF, and
   ignition and all other switches OFF.

**General Points**

 * To run reliably, aerplanes require:
    1. Fuel (more specifically, correct fuel/air mixture).
    2. Ignition by spark plugs at the correct time.
    3. Good mechanical condition.

**1. Fuel**

 * Fuel starvation happens too frequently. Could be caused by reliance on
   inaccurate gauges, not checking contents visually (dipping tanks), poor
   flight planning, and poor monitoring of in-flight consumption.
 * Could also be caused by selecting the wrong tank.
 * **Develop the habit of frequently and regularly checking fuel contents, tank
   selection, and fuel pressure (if possible) in flight.**
 * More remote causes of fuel starvation are: failure of the engine pump (in
   which case use the electrically-driven aux pump), or blockage of the main
   fuel line by water or other contamination (unlikely if the correct fuel
   drain procedures are followed).

**2. Mixture**

 * Correct use of the mixture determines how smoothly the engine runs, as well
   as fuel consumption.
 * For most light aircraft (without EGT), correct leaning comes from being able
   to hear and feel when the engine is operating correctly, ie. free of vibration.
 * Pay attention to correct leaning of mixture, particularly when cruising at
   altitude. **Prolonged use of over-rich mixture is not good for the engine**,
   as well as causing higher fuel consumption than expected.
 * Depending on density altitude (eg. very hot day) it make make sense to lean as
   low as ground level. Some organisations have an altitude limit (eg. not below
   3,000' ASL), in which case follow that limit.
 * **Ensure the priming pump is locked** after starting. An unlocked pump can
   cause fuel to be drawn into the system, adding fuel, and causing rough running.
 * Also take care using carburettor heat, there's a bit reduction in air density,
   making the mixture richer than without it. Do not run for long periods with
   carburettor heat applied unless absolutely necessary.

**3. Ignition**

 * Complete loss of both magnetos simultaneously is extremely unlikely. If one
   fails the engine can operate fine on the remaning system, at a slightly lower
   RPM than normal.
 * Ignition problems are often in the nature of a failure or fouling of one or
   more spark plugs, or 'leakage' of high-voltage current caused by a *breakdown
   of the insulation in the ignition harness and 'shorting' of the spark to
   earth.*
 * **If the engine is running rough, but properly leaned and not in conditions
   conducive to ice, it's likely it's caused by an ignition problem, particularly
   if it's come on suddenly, is intermittent, or begins to mis-fire.**
    * Action could be as follows:
       * **Fouling** - could be caused if engine has been running at low RPM for
         a long period of time. Remedied by operating at a higher power setting/
         CHT.
       * **Leakage of high tension line(s)** - indicated if engine has been
         operating at high altitude and high power in wet weather. May be
         remedied as the aircraft descends at lower power and/or with drier
         conditions.
    * If neither seems to be the cause, a general electrical problem elsewhere
      is indicated (eg. plug failure, shorting in low-tension circuitry,
      including ignition switch)
    * If the rough running warrants it: **you could try reducing power to a
      low cruise setting, and switching to either L or R magnetos**. If this
      remedies the issue, continue on that setting and aim to land as soon as
      possible.

# Mechanical Condition

**As an owner/operator** you are responsible for following approved maintenance
practices and procedures for the engine and aircraft. To ensure the aircraft
remains in airworthy condition, *you must record all operating times
accurately and follow approved maintenance procedures for it.*

**As a pilot** you need to be satisfied that any aircraft you are about to fly
has been properly maintained and is in airworthy condition. Do not fly if this
is not the case.

# Rough Running

Possible causes and possible remedies:

 * **Incorrect Mixture** - amount of roughness depends on how imbalanced the
   mixture is. Expect the mixture to be *rich* if levelling out from a climb to
   cruise. Expect mixture to be *lean* if completing a descent to low altitude.

 * **Carburettor Ice** - first sign is an unexplained gradual loss of RPM, may
   or may not be accompanied by rough running. If in conditions favouring
   carburettor ice, apply full carburettor heat. If successful, return to
   OFF.

 * **Faulty Ignition** - rough running or vibration from this is likely to
   occur suddently, and may be intermittent. **If this occurs after a period
   flying at a low power setting**, try flying at increased power to burn
   off possible spark plug fouling.

 * **Mechanical Reasons** - out-of-balance condition, or mechanical failure
   can cause excess vibration, although extremely rare. **Damage to a
   propellor** (eg. by a stone) can result in a regular vibration, which
   can be eased by changing RPM and/or airspeed. Any serious vibration
   requires a landing as soon as possible. In some cases *it may be best
   to shut down the engine and carry out a forced landing without power.*
