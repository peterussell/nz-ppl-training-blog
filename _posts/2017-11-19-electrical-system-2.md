# The Ammeter

Measures electrical current (in amperes/amps) flowing at a particular place in the
circuit, indicating how well the system is performing. There are two types, the
**left-zero ammeter** and the **center-zero ammeter.**

**The left-zero Ammeter**

 * **Measures only the output of the alternator** (or generator).
 * Graduated scale from 0 on the left-hand side, and increases to a maximum (usually
   the rated capacity of the alternator, eg. 60 amps).
 * Indicates only the **load being placed on the alternator/generator**, ie. the
   load determined by the number of electrical items switched on and how much power
   they demand.
 * Indications of the left-zero ammeter are:
    * Battery switch ON and engine OFF, *or* engine ON and alternator OFF, ammeter
      will show zero.
    * Normal operation - engine running and alternator ON, ammeter shows alternator
      output, *amount of current flowing from alternator to electrical services and
      the battery.*

**The centre-zero Ammeter**

 * **Measure the flow of current *either* into or out of the battery.**
 * Current into the battery is *charge*, ammeter shows positive (+).
 * Current out of the battery is *discharge*, ammeter shows negative (-).
 * No current flow is shown by the needle in centre-zero position.
 * With the battery ON and no alternator output, ammeter will indicate a discharge,
   meaning the battery is providing current for the electrical circuits. Amount
   of discharge depends on number of circuits and their consumption.

# The Master Switch

 * The master switch controls all circuits in the *aircraft electrical system*.
   Note, as explained earlier, this *doesn't* include the magnetos.
 * Master must be ON for any electrical services to receive power, or for the
   battery to be recharged while the engine is running.
 * It should be OFF after stopping the engine, to prevent the battery going flat.
 * In an aircraft with an **alternator** installed, the master switch is split.
    * One half for operating the **battery switch**, which **connects the battery
      power to the bus bar**.
    * One half is the **alternator switch**, for **energising the alternator**.
      It connects the alternator field to the bus bar, providing the alternator
      with battery power for field excitation.
 * Both switches must be ON for normal operation.
 * They can be switched on separately, but *only the alternator can be switched
   off separately*, turning the battery off will also turn the alternator off.

# Fuses, Circuit Breakers, Overload Switches

 * These are for protecting the equipment from electrical overload.
 * In case of an overload, a fuse wire will melt (blow), a CB will pop. In
   either case it breaks the circuit, possibly preventing an electrical fire.
 * **Overload switches** are combined ON/OFF switches and overload protectors,
   they switch themselves off if they experience an electrical overload.

# Typical Electrical Systems

The POH outlines specific electrical systems for the aircraft. It varies greatly
between aircraft, but certain important services may include:

 * Some, or all, **gyroscopic flight instruments**. Often an electrically
   powered turn coordinator, and vacuum-driven AH and DI to provide redundancy.
 * Fuel quantity indicators, possibly oil temperatur, gauge.
 * Starting system.
 * Lights: landing, beacon, strobe, cabin, instrument.
 * Radios.

# Operational Aspects

Consult the POH, but the following general points are useful:

 * During preflight, don't continuously operate devices which require cooling
   (eg. pitot heater, landing lights).
 * Do not start the engine with radio and unnecessary electrical equipment
   switched on, due to large voltage fluctuations during start. Similarly,
   turn off these services before shutting down the engine.
 * Avoid prolonged starter operation to avoid draining the battery.
 * Release starter motor button/key once started.
 * Check the alternator/generator is operating properly after startup.
 * Monitor the ammeter and voltmeter during flight. Some fluctuation is normal,
   but large continued deflections require attention.
 * Make sure the battery master switch is OFF before leaving the aircraft.

# Electrical Malfunctions

With the engine running, the ammeter can indicate two faults:

 * Insufficient current to charge the battery. Centre-zero will show a negative
   reading, left-zero will indicate zero or abnormally low charge rate.
 * Too much current, both will indicate an abnormally high positive charge rate.

**Insufficient Current from the Alternator**

 * Turn off unnecessary electrical equipment.
 * Land as soon as practical, you're now running on the battery.

**Too Much Current**

 * Battery could overheat and become a hazard.
 * If the fault is caused by a faulty voltage regulator, equipment like radios
   could be affected. In aircraft with an overvoltage sensor, it may shut down
   the alternator and illuminate a warning light in the cockpit.
 * **Cycling** - it's possible a voltage spike could trip the overvoltage
   sensor, try cycling the alternator OFF and ON again **provided the battery
   is fully charged.**
    * If, after two attempts, the warning light illuminates again, or the
      alternator continues to drop off line, this indicates the fault is more
      serious.
    * Switch the alternator OFF and proceed as for an alternator failure.

# Resetting Fuses/Circuit Breakers

 * If a fuse blows or CB pops, suspect an electrical overload and proceed with
   caution.
 * If there is no smell or other sign of burning or overheating, the normal
   procedure is to reset a CB *once only*. If it pops again, you can be fairly
   sure of an electrical problem. Do not reset a second time.
 * Similarly, a fuse wire should not be replaced more than once. Spare fuses of
   the correct type and rating should be available in the cockpit.
 * **Do not replace a blown fuse with one of a higher rating,** this may allow
   excessive current to flow through the circuit that's supposed to be protected
   by the fuse, possibly resulting in an electrical fire.
