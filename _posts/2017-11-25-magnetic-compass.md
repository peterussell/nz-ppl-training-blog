# The Magnetic Compass

 * Primary reference for direction in majority of light aircraft. Diplays the heading under
   the lubber line.
 * Earth's magnetic field is relatively week. The magnetic compass aligns itself with the
   earth's magnetic lines of force. Because of this, **the magnetic compass will only
   indicate direction accurately when read in straight and level flight, in smooth flying
   conditions.**

# Direction

 * In aviation, direction's almost always expressed in degrees relative to (true or magentic
   north.
 * These are three digit groups (090, 270, 325). Runway directions are rounded off to two
   digits - eg. runway heading 332 degrees would be RWY 33.
 * A *freely suspended horizontal bar magnet* will swing to point its north-seeking end at
   the north pole, and will therefore align itself with the earth's magnetic lines of force.
 * The direct-reading compass uses this -
    * Small magnets attached to the compass card - and free to rotate with it - seek out the
      north magnetic pole.

# Earth's Magnetic Field

 * The earth has a magnetised core with magnetic poles at the end, deep under the earth.
 * The magnetic poles complete a circule parth around their geographic counterparts *each
   960 years.*
 * **OVer each magnetic pole, the lines of magnetic force are *at right angles to the earth's
   surface.*** About halfway between the poles, the lines are parallel to the surface.

# Magnetic Variation

 * Lines of latitude and longitude (meridians) on a map are relative to *true* north and south.
 * The meridians run north south, lines of latitude run perpendicular.
 * At some points on earth, true and magnetic north coincide, but mostly they don't and the
   direction of true north will vary from magnetic.
 * The difference between true north and magnetic north *at any given point* is called the
   **magnetic variation.**
    * If the magnetic points *east of true north* the variation is said to be east, and vice
      versa for west.
 * Amount and direction of variation is plotted on aeronautical charts with dashed lines
   called **isogonals** - joining places with the same variation.
 * In New Zealand, variation is **East** - the magnetic direction is less than the true
   direction by the amount stated.

# Deviation

 * Other magnetic fields in the aircraft can cause the compass to deviate from its accurate
   reading. They can be caused by metallic parts of the aircraft, electrical components, etc.
 * The combined effect is called **deviation.**
 * The amount of deviation on different compass headings differs aircraft-to-aircraft. It's
   determined through a procedure called a **compass swing** for the particular aircraft.
 * Results from the compass swing are displayed on a card in the cockpit.

**Precautions when carrying Magnetic or Metal Goods**

 * Do not place metal or electric objects near the compass, eg. clipboards, metal ring
   binders, headphones, cellphones, etc.

# Magnetic Compass Construction

 * Modern aircraft has a **direct-reading** compass, filled with a liquid supporting a float.
 * The float supports a bar magnet, which is free to pivot.
 * The liquid:
    * Supports some of the weight of the magnet.
    * Reduces friction.
    * Dampens oscillations.
 * The compass magnet and card swing freely inside the casing, and **maintain a (fairly)
   constant heading**. The aircraft and casing swings around the compass card, which provides
   a heading reading under the lubber line, on the compass casing.
 * Remember, the airplane swings around the compass card, which remains fixed.

# Magnetic Dip

 * As well as aligning horizontally, the magnet will also try to align *vertically* with the
   magnetic lines, this angle is called **magnetic dip.**
 * Dip is greatest near the north and south magnetic poles, and nearly zero near the equator
   (where the magnetic lines parallel earth's surface).
 * To keep the card more or less level in flight, it's constructed with its CG *well below
   its pivot point*.

**However, this can't be completely compensated for in this way, and there will always be a
remaining horizontal displacement between the point of suspension and the CG.

In the southern hemisphere, the CG of the compass is *always offset slightly to the north of
the pivot point.* This horizontal displacement between the two gives rise to errors in the
indicated compass headings when the aircraft is being *accelerated*.**

# Acceleration Error

 * Three things to remember:
    * Think of the north end as *weighted*, the weight has inertia during accel/decel.
    * On a magnetic compass, you're looking at the *opposite side* of the card, readings are
      'backward'.
    * Works the opposite to ANDS.
 * When **accelerating** on an easterly or westerly heading, will show more **southerly**.
 * When **decelerating** on an easterly or westerly heading, will show more **northly**.
 * When accelerating or decelerating on a northly or southerly, no error occurs.

# Turning Error

 * In a turn, the magnet & card tilt with the aircraft and are no longer horizontal.
 * When turning through **northerly or southerly headings**, a component of dip now acts
   in the plane of rotation, and causes errors.
 * When turning through **easterly or westerly headings**, dip acts directly toward or
   away from the pivot and there's no turning error.
 * Turning error is significant, in medium bank turns, typically 30 degrees.
 * In turns through **north**, the *indicated heading leads the actual heading.*
 * In turns through **south**, the *indicated heading lags the actual heading.*

**ONUS - Overshoot North, Undershoot South.**

 * On northerly headings, roll out of the turn about 30 degrees past the desired heading.
 * On southerly headings, roll out about 30 degrees before the desired heading.
 * As required headings get closer to east or west, reduce the overshoot/undershoot amount.
 * In steep turns (over 45 degree bank) the magnetic compass usually becomes completely
   unreliable.

# Serviceability Checks

 * Liquid should be free of bubbles and not discoloured.
 * Glass should not be cracked.
 * Some compasses can be tilted in their mountings, ensure they're level.
 * Check deviation card location.
 * Check compass indication is approximately correct (eg. runway headings).
 * Check turns are correct direction during taxi turns.
