# The Fuel System

 * Fuel is stored in tanks, normally in the wings.
 * High wings are often gravity fed (no fuel pump), low wings require a fuel pump.
   Gravity feed systems are typically now on older or simpler high wings.

**Basic Components**

 * **Fuel Tanks:** usually separate tanks in either wing. Older biplanes may have
   a single tank in the centre of the upper wing. Filler caps are fitted with
   an overflow drain.
 * **Vents/Expansion Spaces:** allows fuel to be vented above the level of the
   filler cap. May happen as fuel is warmed (eg. after coming from a cool
   underground tank), helps relieve pressure. **Vents also prevent a vacuum
   forming** by allowing air above the fuel in the tank to remain at atmospheric
   pressure. Often forward-facing to maintain positive air pressure above fuel.
 * **Sumps/Drain Cocks:** sumps fitted at bottom of each tank, where heavier-than-
   fuel impurities can collect and be drained (eg. dirt, water). A drain cock is
   fitted at the lowest point for fuel sampling, inspection, and draining any
   contaminants.
 * **Standpipe:** outlet from each fuel tank to the *fuel selector valve*, and
   the main supply line. This is about the same level as the *top of the pump.*
   Together with a filter screen over the outlet, helps prevent impurities from
   entering the fuel system.
    * Because the **fuel outlet is above the level of the sump** there will
      always be a few litres of unusable fuel in each tank.
 * **Fuel Selector/Shut-off Valve:** fuel lines from each tank meet at the fuel
   selector/shut-off, operated from the cockpit. This valve (**'fuel cock'**)
   allows selecting ON/OFF, and possibly individual tanks.
 * **Fuel Strainer/Drain Valve:** normally accessible under the engine cowling.
   Should be checked and closed during pre-flight.

# Engine-driven & Electric Fuel Pumps

As mentioned, some high-wing aeroplanes don't require fuel pumps. Low-wing and
other high-wings do. They normally have two:

 1. Engine-driven pump.
 2. Electrically-driven auxilliary pump.

It's normal for the aux pump to be ON to prime the lines and provide fuel
pressure during starting. A **fuel pressure gauge** will provide information
on fuel pressure. If reading low, turn on the aux pump to provide pressure.

Generally also switched ON for take-off, landing, when changing tanks, and
for low flying, as a backup to the engine driven pump. Refer to the POH for
the correct procedure.

# Priming Pump

 * Hand operated pump used (when required) to pump raw fuel directly into
   the induction manifold near one or more cylinders.
 * Normally required when starting a cold engine, especially on a cold day,
   because the cranking speed of the starter *isn't fast enough to lift
   much fuel from the carburettor*. In cold conditions, *fuel is reluctant
   to vaporize*, making the mixture too lean. On a hot day, vaporization is
   improved.
 * Conversely, be wary of priming too much, or pumping the throttle while
   starting. The mixture can be far too rich and possibly result in engine fire.
 * **The primer must be locked when the engine is running** to prevent
   excessive fuel being sent to the cylinders via the priming line, causing an
   over-rich mixture.

# Fuel Gauges

 * Most light aircraft have *electrically operated* fuel gauges.
 * **Most accurate** in straight and level flight. Possibly (quite) innacurate
   in climbs, descents, or turns.
 * Generally a good idea not to rely on fuel gauges, calculate fuel burn and
   cross-check in the air, and visual inspection during pre-flight.
 * Remember that specified fuel consumption rate assumes *correct leaning*. If
   this isn't done, fuel consumption could be up to 20% higher.

# Operational Aspects

**Use of Fuel Selector Valve**

 * May be just ON/OFF, or LEFT/RIGHT/BOTH/OFF. Must be checked it's physically
   located in the correct detent before start-up, and in take-off and landing
   **DVAs (Drill of Vital Actions).**
 * It's bad practice to run a tank dry in flight before switching, because air
   may enter the fuel lines and cause a vapour lock. This could stop fuel from
   the new tank entering the engine, and make it difficult or impossible to
   restart the engine.
 * When switching fuel tanks, it's advisable to **switch on the electric boost
   pump** (if installed) to guarantee fuel pressure to the carburettor. The
   *fuel pressure should be monitored while switching tanks*.

In the event of sudden loss of power, suspect two things:

 1. Lack of fuel to the engine;
 2. Carburettor icing.

If lack of fuel is the cause:

 * Close the throttle (to avoid a surch when the engine restarts).
 * Select the correct fuel tank.
 * Turn the boost pump ON.
 * Set mixture FULL RICH.

If carburettor ice is the cause:

 * Apply carburettor heat.
