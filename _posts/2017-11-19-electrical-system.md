# The Electrical System

A typical modern light aircraft has a **DC electrical system**, with power produced
by an **alternator** (or generator on some older aircraft) when the engine is running,
or from the battery when not running.

The current runs through wires and the **bus bar** to the electrical unit needing
power, then to **ground** through a **ground wire** attached to the aircraft
structure, which is the return path of the electrical circuit.

# The Battery

 * When terminals are connected to an electrical circuit, checmical energy is
   converted to electrical energy and a current will flow.
 * A serviceable battery can be charged if an *electrical source with higher voltage
   (or electrical pressure) is connected in the circuit.
 * A battery is sometimes called an *accumulator* because it can accumulate
   electricity.
 * Can think of a battery like a water tank. If the tank is full, it provides a good
   flow (current) when the tap is open (circuit is connected). If, after turning the
   tap on, a replacement flow of water (current) is available at sufficient pressure
   (voltage), the tank will be topped up. If there is *no* inflow (charge), or the
   inflow is too small to replace the outflow, the tank (battery) will eventually
   become empty.
 * How long a battery will provide current without a replacement charge depends on
   the *size of the battery* and the *amount of current* being drawn from it.
    * **Battery capacity is measured in *ampere hours*.**
    * eg. a battery rated at 60 ampere hours should be able to provide a current of
      60 amps for one hour, or 10 amps for 6 hours.

**Aircraft Batteries**

Aircraft batteries will probably be either **lead acid**, or more modern - a
**nickel-cadmium (nicad)** battery.

 * **Lead Acid** - contains a corrosive acid electrolyte. If charged at too high
   a rate, can 'buckle' and the electrolyte may boil and spill on to the aircraft,
   causing damage. These also give off large quantities of hydrogen, so need to
   be well ventilated.
 * **Nicad** - smaller, lighter, more efficient. Serious risk of explosion if
   overheated.

**In either case, it's important to monitor the rate of charge on the ammeter.**

The battery provides initial power to turn the engine over and start it with an
**electric starter motor**, and also provides backup or **emergency electrical
power.**

Once running, the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs electrical power
from the battery. The engine-driven alternator (or generator) provides current to
recharge the battery after the engine has started.

# Ground Power Source

 * Aircraft battery may be insufficient for starting large aircraft engines.
 * To use a ground power source, the aircraft electrical master switch must
   incorporate a GROUND - FLIGHT position so only external or on-board supplies
   can be used at a single time.
 * During startup, the switch is placed in GROUND, once engines are started and
   power disconnected, switch is placed in FLIGHT.

# Alternator

 * Mechanically driven by the engine, produces power when the engine is running.
 * The *basic output of an alternator is AC, which is rectified (usually internally
   with diodes) for the DC system.
 * The alternator recharges the battery.

**Alternator Field Current**

 * Although the engine may be running and turning the rotor inside the alternator
   over, it **requires battery power to energize (or 'excite') its field windings
   before it can generator power.**
 * Once it's generating, the alternator usually provides sufficient power to
   become self-sustaining.

**Important...**

 * If, during flight, the battery is flat or partially charged and the alternator
   is switched OFF then back ON, there may be insufficient power to keep the
   field windings energized to enable the alternator to start again.
 * Therefore, **do not start a flight with an uncharged (flat) battery).** It
   could result in total loss of electrical power if the alternator fails or is
   switched OFF momentarily.
 * If the battery is flat (unable to turn the engine over properly on start)
   have it replaced or recharged before flight.

# Generator

 * Some older aircraft have a generator instead of an alternator.
 * A generator **automatically produceds DC** because of the way it's built
   (with a *commutator*).
 * The **disadvantages** are:
    * Larger and heaver for the same amount of power as an alternator.
    * Produce less current per RPM, therefore worse at low RPM operations.

# The Bus Bar

 * Aircraft electrical systems normally have one or more bus bars. These are
   a main conductor and distributor of electrical power.
 * Power is supplied to the bus bar by the alternator and battery, and from
   there distributed to the electrical components that require power.
 * May be a metal bar.

# Overvoltage Protection

 * Alternator/generator can produce a higher voltage than required by the
   aircraft system. Therefore, the generated voltage must be controlled.
 * This is achieved by the **voltage regulator**.
 * To guard against voltage regulator malfunction, some aircraft have
   **overvoltage protectors** (overvoltage relays).
 * There may also be a voltmeter, with an overvoltage light.
