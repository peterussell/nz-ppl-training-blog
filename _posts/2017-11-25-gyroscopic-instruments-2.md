# The Attitude Indicator

 * Uses gyroscopic property of **rigidity in space**.
 * Rotor lies flat, rotates in a plane parallel to the earth's surface, which is indicated
   by the card inside the AI - the casing and aircraft rotate around it. A miniature
   aircraft is displayed representing the attitude of the actual aircraft.
 * AI shows **pitch attitude** and **bank angle**.
 * Be sure to check power source of the AI, suction should be indicating a minimum of
   about 4.5" Hg.

**Limits**

 * Some artificial horizons, especially vacuum driven, have limits of pitch and bank.
 * If exceeded, may cause the gyro to **topple** and read incorrectly.
 * May have a **caging** device which should be used *before entering manoeuvres that could
   cause the gyro to topple*. Caging helps prevent damage that may be caused by toppling
   during these manoeuvres.

# Heading Indicator

 * Magnetic compass is the *primary* indicator of direction, but can be difficult to read in
   turbulence, and is subject to acceleration and turning errors. The HI compensates for these.
 * HI is easier to read, but does gradually lose alignment with the magnetic compass due to
   the **earth's rotation** and **friction in the gyro**.

**Realigning (syncronising) the HI**

 * Some aircraft automatically maintain alignment between the magnetic compass and HI, but
   most training aircraft require manual alignment, before flight and about every 10-15
   minutes.
    * A 3 degree drift is acceptable during this period.
 * In the air **ensure conditions are calm and *wings are level* before realignment.
 * **In turbulence** - hold the aircraft on a steady heading with a visual reference point,
   read the compass when conditions allow it to settle - or average swings from the compass.
   Then, maintain the same heading with respect to the reference point, and realign the HI.

**Operational Checks**

 * Check power source (vacuum or electrical).
 * Check HI turns in correct direction when taxiing.
