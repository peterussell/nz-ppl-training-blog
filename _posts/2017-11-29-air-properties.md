# Density

 * Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, *oxygen* is the part needed to sustain
   power produced by the engine, and life of the pilot.
 * **Density** is a measure of **how many molecules are present in any given volume.**
    * Molecules of air have a known, finite mass.
    * Density of air at sea level is about **1.225 kg/cubic metre**.
 * Air density determines how well an aircraft and engine perform; as it climbs air density
   decreases and wings can't generate as much lift, and engine power output decreases.
 * Air density is therefore important to predicting flight performance, but it's nearly
   impossible to measure directly --
 * Instead, we use two properties of air which affect air density to calculate the density:
   **pressure** and **temperature**.

**Pressure**

 * Air molecules are in continuous motion, vibrating at high speed in random directions.
 * When each molecule collides with a solid surface, it exerts a tiny pressure on it.
 * The sum of the forces exerted by all molecules colliding with and rebounding from a
   surface add up to a total force called *pressure*.

In the International (SI) system of units, pressure is measured in *Newtons/sq. metre,
or *pascals*.

**1 pascal (Pa) = 1 kg.force/sq. metre.**

Because a pascal is fairly small, we normally measure **hectopascals (hPa) in aviation.**

 * Pressure on a surface depends in the first instance on its *density*. For a constant
   temperature, as the air density increases so does the pressure it exerts.
 * Therefore, amount of pressure is a good indicator of air density.

**Temperature**

 * Temperature is a **measure of how much energy the air molecules of substance have, or how
   fast they vibrate.**
 * If heat is transferred to air, its molecules become more *excited*, the temperature will
   rise, and because they have more *kinetic energy* the force the collide with surfaces is
   higher.
 * Therefore, *if heated air is confined* in a container and unable to expand, its **pressure
   will rise** even though its density remains constant.
    * Conversely, if the air is cooled the pressure will drop.
 * However, *if the heated air is not contained* its molecules will move further apart and
   it expands. Fewer molecules will be present in the original volume and its density will
   decrease. The parcel of heated air will continue to expand until its pressure is equal
   to the surrounding air.
    * Conversely, if an uncontained parcel of air is cooled, it will contract and its
      density will increase.

**Summary**

 * In masses of air with the same temperature, the one with the highest pressure has the
   highest density.
 * In masses of air with the same pressure, the one with the lowest temperature has the
   highest density.

# Density, Pressure, Temperature in the Atmosphere

 * The atmosphere is a blanket of air surrounding the earth, held in place by gravity,
   and extending up to **about 500 miles**.
 * Air near the surface is most dense.
 * The atmosphere has several layers, we'll discuss the **troposphere**.

**Troposphere:** lowest part of the atmosphere, up to **about 36,000'.**

 * In the troposphere, air density, pressure, and temperature all decrease with altitude.
 * Due to differing amounts of *solar radiation* at the surface, atmospheric conditions
   around the earth aren't uniform.
 * Pressure, temperature, and density of equatorial, polar, and mid-latitude airmasses are
   very different and change with seasons.
 * To provide a yardstick against which to compare the different conditions, an
   **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)** has been devised. It provides a means of
   calibrating and setting altimeters, and predicting aircraft performance.

**International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)**

ISA is a hypothetical set of atmospheric conditions which represent an **average of
conditions world-wide.** ISA conditions are:

 * Sea level pressure of **1013.2 hPa.**
 * Pressure decrease of about **1 hPa every 30', to 5,000'**, and a lower rate thereafter.
 * Sea level temperature of **+15 degrees C**, decreasing at a uniform rate of **1.98 deg C
   per 1,000'** up to 36,090'.
 * Sea level density of **1.225 kg/m<super>3</super>, decreasing (like pressure) at a rapid
   rate initially and a slower rate after.

Conditions anywhere on the globe will rarely match ISA conditions. However, when we fly we
should be aware of how much conditions vary from standard, giving an indication of how
well the aircraft will perform (among anothe things).

Air *density* concerns us most, so with regard to temperature and pressure:

 * **High temperature** = lower air density = worse performance.
 * **Low temperature** = higher air density = better performance
 * **High pressure** = higher density = better performance.
 * **Low pressure** = lower density = worse performance.

Therefore:

 * **High pressure + low temperature** = best performance.
 * **Low pressure + high temperature** = worst performance.

# Density Altitude

**Density Altitude** is the altitude in the ISA (therefore, a height) which has the same
density as the actual altitude you're trying to measure.

 * If actual conditions are the same as ISA, then actual altitude is the same as density
   altitude.
 * If actual conditions differ, then density altitude will be above or below density altitude.
 * Density altitude is used for **measuring expected aircraft performance**.
 * Aircraft performance charts are based on ISA, but if we want to know how the aircraft will
   perform where we actually are and at the actual time we're there, we need to adjust them
   for the current density altitude.
    * To do this, we need to know the **temperature and pressure at the altitude we are
      concerned with**, either -
    * Enter these into charts to obtain density altitude.
    * Work them out with a navigation computer (covered in the Navigation Manual).
    * Do a manaul calculation.

Another way of defining density altitude is:

 * **QNH converted to *pressure altitude* (ie. QNE), the corrected for *temperature* difference
   between ISA and actual.

# Humidity

 * ISA is based on dry air (contains no water vapour - water in gas form).
 * Real air usually contains between 20% - 80%.
 * When water vapour mixes with air, some of the other molecules (oxygen, nitrogen) are
   displaced.
 * **Water vapour molecules have *less* mass than the molecules of dry air they replace,**
   meaning - at the same temperature and pressure - moist air is less dense than dry air.
 * In normal conditions, this doesn't make a significant difference to its density - however...
 * **Because warm air can contain much more water vapour than cold air...

**At high temperatures and high humidity, the reduction in density may be significant.**

# Viscosity

 * The tendency of molcules (air or liquid) to 'stick together' and cling to any solid
   surface they come in contact with.
 * Air has viscosity, and it plays an important part in aerodynamics.
 * When air moves across a *perfectly falt plane surface*, the layer of molecules in immediate
   contact with the surface will be brought to a stand-still (or nearly so) because of
   viscosity.
 * Successive layers of air above that layer will be slowed down by decreasing amounts, until
   a point where the effect if viscosity is no longer felt.
 * **This layer of retarded air is called the boundary layer.**
 * The boundary layer is not normally very thick, usually 1 - 20 mm depending on conditions.
 * We'll discuss viscosity more later.
