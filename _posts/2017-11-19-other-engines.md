# Other Engines

Other engines may include radials, two stroke (many microlights and some home-builts
use these), diesel, or turbine (jet) configured as a turbo-prop or helicopter
powerplant. This section covers basic operating principles and highlights differences.

# Radial Engine

 * Cylinders arranged in a circle around the crankshaft.
 * Usually an odd number of cylinders in each row (or bank). Larger radial engines,
   eg. commonly used in older aircraft, may have two or more *rows* of cylinders
   placed behind each other.
 * Have a different crankshaft/connecting rod arrangement, and a different
   cam/valve-gear operating mechanism. Otherwise, operating principles are similar
   to those already covered.
 * **Main advantage** is a high power-to-weight ratio. Another is the cylinders are
   more equally presented to the airflow and results in more even cooling.
 * **Main disadvantage** is more drag created than an inline engine of equal power.

**Operation**

 * Crankshaft of a radial engine has one crank for each row of cylinders to which
   the **master connecting rod** is attached. Remaining connecting rods on the
   row are 'slaves'.
 * The crankshaft must make two revolutions for each piston in the row to complete
   four strokes (same as in-line).
 * Valve operation components are largely the same. Pushrods are actuated by
   staggered lobes or cams around the periphery of a *cam ring*.
    * The cam ring is mounted concentrically with the crankshaft, and driven by it
      through planetary gears.
    * The cam ring rotates at *half engine speed* and each of the valves is
      operated once in the four-stroke cycle of each cylinder.

# Two-Stroke Engine

 * Requires only two strokes of the piston (one up and one down) to complete a full
   power cycle.
 * **Has no valves** - piston acts as a sliding valve, covering and uncovering
   outlet ports in the side of the cylinder.
 * On the *first (upward) stroke*, fuel-air mixture is drawn into the crankcase,
   the charge is compressed and ignited.
 * On the *second (downward) stroke) is both a power stroke and exhaust stroke
   combined. Initially, expanding gases push the piston down. As the piston passes
   the exhaust port, burned gases are exhausted to atmosphere. At the same time,
   descending piston pressurises the crankcase fuel/air mixture, forcing it into
   the cylinder behind the retreating gases.
 * There is normally a simple poppet-type (?) valve located in the inlet manifold,
   between the carburettor and crankcase, which opens against the action of a light
   spring to admit the fuel-air mixture when the valuve moves up, and closes again
   when the piston moves down to prevent the pressurised mixture from moving back
   out through the carburettor.
 * Some of the fuel/air mixture does escape through the exhaust port since both
   ports are uncovered simultaneously. To minimise this, the top of the piston is
   usually shaped as a barrier to prevent this.

**Lubrication Differences between Two- and Four-stroke Engines**

 * The four-stroke engine uses a journal (drilled channel) in the crankshaft to
   distribute oil to the big-end bearings and crankcase.
 * The two-stroke engine uses it s crankcase as a transfer pump for the fuel-air
   mixture, and uses a different lubrication principle.
 * **Lubricating oil is mixed with the fuel** (in a specified proportion) and
   used to fill the fuel tank. Some systems store them in separate tanks and
   mix them in the induction system.
 * As the fuel is vaporized, oil is broken up by the fuel (in the stream of air)
   into tiny droplets which lubricate the bearing surfaces of the crankshaft,
   piston, and cylinder. Some remains in the crankcase, but most passes into the
   combustion chamber where it's burned.
 * **Regular automotive petrol** rather than any premium (leaded) oil is usually
   recommended beause the lead tends to deposit on spark plugs.
 * **Caution** - two-stroke engines are still susceptible to carburettor icing,
   although may not be fitted with carburettor heat.

**Advantages**

 * Simpler, fewer working parts (no valves or camshafts), lighter as a result.
 * Two-stroke engines give one pulse of power for every two (as opposed to
   every four) strokes, giving a better distribution of torque. Can also mean
   smaller engines can be built with lighter flywheels to give smooth running.

**Disadvantages**

 * Power/weight ratio is **higher than a four-stroke engine**. However, a
   two-stroken engine of comparable size to a four-stroke does not double in
   power.
    * The two-stroke is less efficient at converting energy in the fuel to
      mechanical energy. Some fuel passes through the cylinder without being
      burnt, and tends to be greater dilution of fresh fuel-air charge by
      unburnt gases remaining in the cylinder from the previous cycle
 * Fuel and oil consumption of two-stroke engines is thus higher.

# Disel Engines

 * Diesel engines have not been widely used in aircraft engines.
 * Although they have excellent fuel consumption characteristics, other factors,
   eg. relatively high weight, have mitigated against them being used in aviation.
 * However, recent advances in diesel technology, and high prices of AVGAS, have
   spurred their interest in GA use.

**Operating Principles**

 * Main differences are they *do not have a spark ignition*, and uses *direct
   fuel injection* so no carburettor is needed.
 * Use **compression ignition**, where temperatures are high enough (typically
   700-900 deg C) to cause spontaneous burning.
 * May be difficult to start because of lack of heat, most therefore have a
   system for preheating combustion chamber to achieve combustion until the
   engine heats up enough to sustain itself. Most common method is **glow
   plugs**, small electric heaters which heat the combustion space.
 * Because no carburettor's used, they have no throttle valve. Air is taken
   directly from the intake port to the inlet valves, or likely through a
   turbocharger and intercooler before going to the cylinders.
    * For aviation, these are invariably required to provide fuel efficiency
      and keep an acceptable power/weight ratio.

**Turbocharger**

 * Compressing intake air to make it more dense, enabling it to accept more
   fuel at the correct ratio, and produce more power per RPM.

**Intercooler**

 * Simple radiator type cooler to cool compressed intake airflow passed
   through it, further increasing density and therefore power per RPM.

**Fuels**

 * Can be made to run on a wider range of *less volatile* fuels than a
   gasoline engine.
 * Normal automotive diesel is a *light fuel oil, similar to kerosene.*
   Most modern aircraft diesel engines will be designed to operate on certain
   grades of **automotive diesel fuel** or **aviation turbine fuel** (eg.
   Jet A1). These are available throughout the world, and generally cheaper than
   AVGAS. Older disel engines can be made to run on a variety of fuels, eg.
   vegetable oil.

**Cooling, Power-to-Weight vs Gasoline Engines**

 * Combustion temperatures and pressures are generally higher than a gasoline
   engine, which leads to *greater combustion efficiency*, but means it usually
   has a **liquid cooling system**, and be **heavier** to withstand the higher
   pressures.
    * These result in the **diesel GA engine being heavier**.
 * To offset this, improved combustion efficiency means a smaller capacity
   engine can produce the same power as a gasoline aero-engine. **An engine the
   same size will be heavier, but will have roughly a 15% improvement in
   fuel consumption**.
