# Carburettor Ice

Ice can form in the carburettor and engine air intake, degrading performance
and possibly leading to engine failure. It can form even when ambient air
is relatively warm, provided there's sufficient moisture.

With a fixed-pitch propellor, a drop in RPM is the first indication of
carburettor ice, along with engine roughness.

There are three causes:

**Refrigeration (or Fuel) Ice**

 * Vaporisation of fuel requires heat energy, and introducing vaporised
   fuel into the inlet airstream significantly reduces its temperature.
 * Absorbing energy from the surround air in the process of vaporsiation
   is called **latent heat of evaporation**. It is the same principle
   that refrigerators work on, which gives it its name.
 * Refrigeration ice forms downstream of the main metering jet in the
   throat of the carburettor, when the temperature drops below 0 deg C.
   If atmospheric conditions are sufficiently moist, water will condense
   and freeze onto the surfaces of the **inlet manifold walls** and
   **butterfly valve**.
 * Refrigeration ice can occur in ambient air temperatures *well above
   freezing*, as high as 25 deg C, when the *relative humidity* exceeds
   50%.

**Throttle Ice**

 * As air accelerates through the venturi, there is a drop in pressure
   with an accompanying drop in temperature. Can cause ice to form on
   and near the throttle (butterfly) valve.
 * The acceleration and temperature drop is *more pronounced at low throttle
   settings*, because the butterfly restricts airflow more and creates a
   substantial pressure drop.
 * This *augments* the cooling already occurring through evaporation.
 * **Carburettor ice is more likely at low throttle settings.**

**NB. refrigeration and throttle ice are most likely when fuel-air mixture
temperature is in the range of 0 deg C to 10 deg C. Visible moisture is
not necessary.

**Impact Ice**

 * Occurs when water droplets below freezing impact on the forward facing
   surfaces of the aircraft and immediately turn to ice.
 * This impacts the carburettor when it forms on the front of the air
   inlet and ducting to the carburettor.
 * May also form if the *temperature of the forward facing surfaces is
   below zero*, eg. if the aircraft has been cruising above the freezing
   level then descends into visible moisture.
 * Impact ice is most likely to occur when:
    * The ambient air temperature is near to or below freezing, and
    * The aircraft is flying through visible moisture.

# Operational Aspects

 * Refrigeration and Throttle ice can both occur when the ambient air
   temperature is high. Be alert in the range **-10 deg C to +20 deg C**
   and especially when the relative humidity is high.
 * Ice can alter the shape of the carburettor throat, disturb smooth flow
   of air, and alter the mixture ratio.

**Symptoms of Carburettor Ice**

 * Rough engine.
 * Loss of RPM.

**Resolution**

 * Carburettor Heat: carburettor inlet air will be drawn from a different
   inlet, and heated by passing through a 'muff' around the hot exhaust
   manifold. Density of the heated air will be lower, so expect an initial
   drop in RPM, possible rough running as the ice is ingested, then an
   increase in RPM and smooth running as operation returns to normal.
 * After the ice is melted and normal operation is resumed, close the
   carburettor heat.
 * If the ice forms again, repeat the operation. If it continues to form,
   either:
    1. Continue flying with full carburettor heat, or
    2. Leave the icing conditions. This is the preferred option.

**Carburettor Air Temperature Gauge (CAT Gauge)**

 * Some aircraft have a CAT gauge which can be used to keep carburettor
   air above the icing range.
 * Can use partial heat to prevent icing.

**Carburettor Heat in Cold Temperatures**

In very cold ambient temperatures, carburettor heat can increase induction
air temperature *into* the range most conducive to forming carburettor
ice, increasing the risk instead of decreasing it.

**During Descent with Low Power Settings**

 * It's common practice to use carburettor heat during low power descents
   to prevent formation of ice, particularly in high humidity areas.
 * The small butterfly openings associated with low power settings
   increase the chance of carburettor ice forming.
 * However, this is **not good practice when the chance of ice forming
   is not present** (eg. dry hot days), because it just increases engine
   temperatures.

**On Short Final**

 * Normally returned to cold in case full power is required to go around.

**Other Notes:

 * Avoid using carburettor heat continuously on the ground because the
   heated carburettor inlet is normally unfiltered. This has the potential
   to introduce dust and grit into the engine, and can increase wear and
   tear or damage.
 * Check carburettor heat operation briefly on the ground, refere to the
   POH for more information on specific procedures.

# **Study Questions**

 * What are the three types of carburettor icing? Describe each.
    1. Refrigerator ice: caused by decrease in temperature due to
       vaporisation of fuel absorbing heat energy from the inlet air,
       in a process called *latent heat of evaporation*. Can occur in
       ambient temperatures up to 25 deg C, at relative humidities of
       50% or more.
    2. Throttle ice: caused by the drop in pressure and temperature
       caused by air flowing through the venturi. Most likely at low
       throttle settings because of a bigger pressure drop.
    3. Impact ice: ice forming on the air inlet. Occurs when the aircraft
       or temperature is below zero, and flying through visible moisture.
 * When should you be most alert for refrigerator and throttle ice?
    * Between -10 deg C and +20 deg C, and high relative humidity.
 * Is visible moisture necessary for refrigerator or throttle icing?
    * No
