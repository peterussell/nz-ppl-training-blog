# The Cooling System

 * Modern light piston aero-engines are almost exclusively **air cooled**.
 * The *horizontally opposed* configuration gives a good compromise between
   the low-drag profile of an inline engine, and a higher-drag but better
   cooled radial.
 * Air-cooled engines have a large number of **cooling fins** around the
   cylinder heads and barrels, increase radiating surface area exposed to
   airflow.
 * Air is directed via cooling ducts at the front of the engine, near the
   propellor hub.
 * At slow speed, the **propellor slipstream plans an important part in providing
   airflow for cooling.**
 * **Ducts** and **baffles** route the air through the fins around cylinders,
   aiming to cool each as evenly as possible. After cooling, the heated air is
   ducted to atmosphere through outlets at the rear of the cowling.
 * Because the engine generates *most heat* at high power, and cooling is
   *least effective* at low speeds, **overheating is most likely at high
   power settings and slow speeds.**
 * Conversely, **cooling can be too effective at high speed and low power**,
   eg. during a long glide at low power settings.

**Cowl Flaps**

 * Some aircraft are fitted with cowl flaps. Can be operated from the cockpit,
   and give better control over engine cooling.
 * When open, they allow *more air to escape from the engine compartment* which
   increases flow and cooling.
 * Open cowl flaps also increase **parasitic drag** (sometimes 'cooling drag').
 * In general:
    * Open for taxiing once CHT has risen to recommended range after starting.
    * Open for takeoff, partially open or closed during climb and cruise,
      closed during low-power descent.
    * Open on final approach in case of go-around.

# Operational Aspects

 * Be aware of conditions which lead to overheating: high power, low airspeed,
   and to overcooling: high speed, low power. In general, avoid:
    * Running the engine while on the ground for long periods with the throttle
      closed. If unavoidable, point into the wind when possible.
    * Climbing at high power settings and low airspeed for long periods of time.
      Refer to limitations in the POH.
    * Descending with the throttle closed for extended periods. Opening the
      throttle regularly helps maintain cylinder temperatures, as well as a
      supply for carburettor heat if needed. Also helps prevent throttle ice
      and fouling of spark plugs.

**CHT Gauges**

 * If fitted, gives a direct indication of how well the cooling system is
   functioning. Make it a habit to *monitor the CHT gauge*.
 * Note that the CHT guage responds relatively slowly to changes in conditions
   which affect temperature.

# Liquid Cooling Systems

 * In New Zealand, generally warbird types with *large in-line engines*, and
   some experimental aircraft with adapated auto engines or diesel engines.
 * **Main advantage** is **more even and steady cooling of cylinders and heads
   can be obtained**, meaning lower thermal shock (rapid heating or cooling).
 * Additionally, at high power, liquid cooled engines can maintain lower
   temperatures than air cooled, allowing **higher compression ratios** without
   risk of detonation.
 * Also **less cooling drag** due to not having to force air through cooling
   fins and baffles (although negligible for training aircraft at relatively
   low airspeeds).
 * **Main disadvantage** is weight and complexity.

**Principle of Operation**

 * Engine is constructed so cylinders and heads are surrounded as much as
   possible by a jacket containing liquid coolant.
 * The cylinders and heads of liquid cooled engines are normally manufactured
   as 'blocks' of metal containing several cylinder bores and a discrete
   head or heads, as opposed to air cooled engines which are normally
   manufactured with discrete cylinders and heads, surrounded by fins.
 * The liquid cooled cylinder block contains galleries and channels for the
   coolant to run through.
 * The coolant system is normally a *closed circuit* through which the coolant
   passes under pressure. Main components are:
    * Engine-driven pump.
    * Thermostat control.
    * Radiator (heat exchanger).
    * Header tank/expansion space.
    * Connecting piping and hoses.
    * Coolant temperature indicates (possibly also quantity and pressure).
 * Engine pump pumps coolant through the engine once started.
 * Coolant picks up heat, but until reaching a certain temperature, the
   thermostat prevents it passing through the radiator.
 * Once the temperature is reached, and increasing amount is allowed to flow
   to the radiator and exchange heat.

**Coolant Types**

 * Coolant can be water, but is more often a mix of **ethylene glycol** and
   water. Ethylene glycol is an *anti-freeze additive*. It also has better
   heat transfer characteristics and a higher boiling point than water.
 * System will operate under pressure, and boiling point of the coolant
   will be further raised in normal operation due to this pressure.
 * Modern systems operate on a 'no fluid loss' design, and therefore have an
   **expansion tank** to provide a buffer of fluid to cope with coolant
   expansion and contraction with temperature rise and fall.
 * The system contains a **pressure relief valve**, but this isn't expected
   to activate in normal operation.
 * At correct engine operating temperatures, the *coolant should be well below
   boiling point*.
