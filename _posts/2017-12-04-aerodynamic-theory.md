# Aerofoils

 * The wings and tail section are *aerofoils* and designed to produce useful aerodynamic
   forces.

**Training Aircraft**

Aerofoils on training aircraft are usually general purpose, with:

 * A rounded leading edge.
 * Reasonable amount of curvature on the upper surface.
 * Less curvature on the lower surface.
 * Sections on the tail section will generally be more symmetrical (similar curve on both
   sides).

**Terms**

 * **Leading edge:** edge facing into the airstream.
 * **Trailing edge:** edge on the downstream side.
 * ** Chord:** line connecting leading and trailing edges.
 * **Thickness:** depth of the aerofoil. On most, the point of maximum thickness is nearer
   the leading edge (about 30-40% back from the leading edge).
 * **Camber:** curvature of a line drawn **equidistant between upper and lower surfaces**.
   Most aerofoils have some camber, symmetrical ones don't.

# Angle of Attack

**Angle between the chord line and Relative Air Flow (RAF).**

 * **RAF** is airflow remote from the aircraft and unaffected by its passage through it.
 * RAF can be represented by a *vector*, ie. direction and velocity.
 * Reverse of the aircraft's flight path vector at any given moment.

# Pressure Distribution

 * An aerofoil placed in a moving airstream at a small angle of attack, parts the air at
   the leading edge.
 * Air flows smoothly above and below the upper and lower surfaces, then joins again at the
   trailing edge.
 * **Static pressure** is *decreased above the wing* and *altered below the wing*.

**Total Reaction (TR)**

 * The net effect of the pressure changes (above)  is to produce forces, mostly in the upward
   direction, but also inclined slightly to the rear.
 * This aerodynamic force is called the **total reaction (TR)**.
 * Over the normal range of operating angles of attack, *the greatest contribution to the TR
   (and therefore lift) is from a reduction in static pressure over the upper surface.*

# Bernoulli's Theorem

**Dynamic Energy + Static Pressure = A Constant**

 * Therefore, wheverever the speed of the airflow is *increased*, the air gains dynamic energy
   and its static pressure is *reduced*.
 * Wherever the speed of airflow is *decreased*, air loses dynamic energy and its static pressure
   is *increased*.

**Bernoulli's Principle at High Speeds**

 * Applies with a good degree of accuracy for airflows **up to about 250kts**.
 * Above this, the effects of **compressibility** and **viscosity** have to be increasingly
   taken into account.
 * Approaching the speed of sound, Bernoulli's Principle is no longer appropriate.

# Streamline Flow

 * If molecules in the airstream follow the same steady and predictable path, it can be
   represented by a **streamline**.
 * There is *no flow across streamlines*, only along them.
 * Streamline flow can be maintained if the molecules of air flowing around or through a body
   can change direction gradually and smoothly. Shapes conforming to this are said to be
   'streamlined*.
 * If airflow changes direction too abruptly, the flow will 'break down' and become turbulent
   and unpredictable.
 * **Bernoullis Principle applies only to streamline flow.**

# Venturi Effect

 * Gives a good example of Bernoulli's Principle.
 * Venturi is a convergent-divergent duct.
 * For a volumen of air entering it *over a given time span*:
    * A venturi will accelerate that airflow and allow it to pass through the restriction in
      the same amount of time.
    * Once it has passed through the restriction, it will decelerate to pass out the exit at
      the same speed it entered.
 * Whenever the air has higher speed than the free stream flow, it has *gained dynamic energy*
   and therefore reduced in static pressure.
 * The greatest pressure reduction is at the throat of the venturi, where the speed is highest.
 * Converging streamlines **do not indicate the air is being compressed**. Given time for the
   airflow to speed up and slow down, air resists being compressed, and amount of compression
   is insignificant up to about 250kts.
