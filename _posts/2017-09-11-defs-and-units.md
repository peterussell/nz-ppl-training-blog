# Units of Measurement

The **Fundamental SI** ('International System of Units') units we'll use:

 * Length: metre (m)
 * Mass: kilogram (kg)
 * Time: second (s)
 * Temperature: degrees celcius (&deg;C)

The **Derived units** are formed by combination of fundamental units:

 * Force: newton (N)
    * A newton is the force required to accelerate a 1kg mass at
      1m/s.
    * Sometimes see the term kilograms force (kg/f). 1kg/f = 9.81N.
 * Pressure: pascal (Pa)
    * 1 Pa = 1 newton per square metre (Nm<sup>2</sup>).
 * Power: watt (W)
    * Power = force x distance per unit time.
    * Watts are equiavelent to Nm/s (Newton-metres per second).
    * Although modern cars are often measured in watts, most light
      aircraft engines are rated in horsepower.
    * 1hp = 746W (~3/4 kW).

**Non-SI Units used in Aviation**

 * Altitude: feet (ft).
 * Navigational distance: nautical miles (nm).
 * Speed (airspeed, groundspeed, wind speed): knots (kts).
    * 1 kt = 0.514 m/s, or 1.85 km/h.

# Speed, Velocity, Acceleration

 * **Speed = distance travelled / time taken.**
    * Speed is a *scalar quantity*, it has magnitude but no direction.
 * **Velocity = distance travelled in a given direction / time taken.**
    * Velocity is a *vectory quantity*, it has magnitude *and* direction.
 * **Acceleration = change of velocity.**
    * Because velocity has both speed and direction, if either of these
      change, then there's a change in accelration.
    * When speed alone changes, there's a straight-line acceleration.
    * When the direction alone changes, a force toward the centre of the
      curved path is imposed. The accelerating force is centrifugal force.
      The object is still accelerating regardless of the fact that its
      speed around the circumference may not be changing.

# Mass and Intertia

 * Mass: the amount of *matter* in an object (kg).
 * Inertia: the tendency of an object to either remain at rest with with
   zero velocity, or continue moving at its present velocity.
    * Inertia depends on mass - *the amount of inertia it has depends solely
      on the amount of mass it has.*
 * Pound: 1lb = 0.45kg, and 1kg = 2.2lbs

# Force, Weight and G

**Force** tries to move a mass out of its state of rest or uniform motion, ie.
it is trying to overcome inertia. How successful it is depends on whether
opposing forces balance it.

**Weight** is the force produced when a mass is attracted by Earth's gravity.
At the surface of the earth, gravity produces an acceleration of 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>.
**Mass** is simply the amount of matter in an object, and therefore a scalar
quanity. **Weight** is a force and therefore a vector quantity. In the case
of weight, the direction is always toward the centre of the earth.

The abbreviation 'g' is used to denote acceleration due to gravity
(9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>).

A body subject to 2g is experiencing twice the force of gravity.

# Momentum

Momentum is mass times velocity: momentum = m x v.

Momentum is the difficulty of stopping a moving object or changing its
its direction. A large mass with low velocity can have the same momentum
as a small object with high velocity.

**Momentum vs Intertia** - a stationary object has no momentum (from the
above definition). Inertia is solely a property of mass, so even a
stationary object retains inertia. If two objects have the same *inertia*
but are travelling at different speeds, they will have different *momentum*,
and the faster one will be harder to stop.
