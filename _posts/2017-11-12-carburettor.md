# Basic Principles

 * Fuel must be mixed with oxygen in the correct proportion in order to burn
   properly. This averages about 1 part fuel to 12 parts air **by weight**.
   The carburettor is what mixes the fuel and air.
 * The carburettor throat contains a venturi (convergent-divergent duct).
   Air flowing through it accelerates and drops in pressure (Bernoulli's
   Principle).
 * The drop in pressure is proportional to the rate of air flow in the venturi,
   which is controlled by a **throttle valve** (butterfly valve) connected to
   the throttle in the cockpit.
 * The main fuel outlet (**jet**) is positioned in the low pressure area.
   The low pressure in the venturi results in fuel being sucked through the
   fuel jet.
 * The jet is calibrated so it *meters* the correct proportion of fuel (by
   weight) into the air before it enters the engine. The fuel vaporises when
   it leaves the jet and mixes with the air.
    * It flows out of the jet, past the throttle butterfly valve, into the
      inlet manifold, and to the cylinders.
 * **The throttle lever has two functions:**
    1. Controls the amount of air entering the cylinders;
    2. Governs the amount of fuel mixed with the air;

# Additional Components

A carburettor described above has a number of deficiencies for an aircraft
engine. These components fix those:

 * Atomisation & diffusion system at the main jet to improve vaporisation.
 * Idling system to provide fuel when butterfly is closed or nearly closed.
 * Accelerating system to increase rate of fuel flow when throttle is opened.
 * Enrichment system to provide extra fuel when throttle approaches fully
   open. Excess fuel doesn't burn, but provides cooling through evaporation.
   Helps prevent *overheating* and *detonation*.
 * Mixture control, and idle cut-off systems.

# Mixture Control

Correct air-fuel mixture is based on *weight*, but a carburettor operates
by metering based on *volume*. **The density (and weight) of air is subject
to change, but the density (and weight) of liquid remains constant.**

 * When air density *decreases*, the weight of air decreases but the weight
   of fuel being metered into it remains constant, and the mixture becomes
   rich.
 * The mixture control allows the pilot to change the ratio of air and
   fuel, keeping it in the proper range. This is achieved by changing the
   amount of fuel being metered into the air.

**Operational Aspects**

 * Mixture is usually in the **Full Rich** position for takeoff and climb,
   unless the climb is extend above (approximately) 5,000'.
 * Exceptions are at high elevation airports, high heat, or other high
   density altitude situations.
    * With the mixture full rich, excess fuel acts as a cooling agent for
      the cylinder walls and piston heads, and helps avoid detonation.
 * As air density decreases, leaning the mixture will result in an increase
   in RPM when the ratio approaches the correct mixture. If you continue
   leaning beyond the correct mixture, power will reduce, the engine may
   start running roughly, and engine temperatures will increase.
 * At that point, move the mixture back to the optimal position, then
   slightly rich (consult the operating manual for the aircraft).
 * Repeat this **at cruise**, or **after power setting changes**.

# Consequences of Rich/Lean Mixtures

 * Engine is usually operated rich of peak to protect against *detonation*,
   *pre-ignition*, and *overheating* the cylinders. These are more
   likely to occur when operating at *more than 70% maximum continuous
   power*.
    * **At power settings above 70%, the mixture control should be
      FULL RICH.**

**Over Rich Mixture (possible outcomes)**

 * Loss of power.
 * Rough running.
 * Fouling of spark plugs.
 * Lead deposits from unburnt fuel on pistons and valves.

**Over Lean Mixture (possible outcomes)**

 * Excessively high cylinder head temperatures.
 * Possible detonation (explosive combustion in cylinders).
    * **Severe detonation can damage an engine quickly.**
 * Loss of power.
 * Possible complete engine failure.

# Idle Cut-off

 * Normal way of shutting the engine down.
 * Moving the mixture to the idle cut-off position moves a small needle
   to cut off fuel flow between the float chamber and venturi.
 * Engine continues to run until all mixture between the inlet manifold
   and the cylinders is burned.
    * **This leaves no combustible mixture in the engine, which is *not*
      the case if the ignition is turned off to shut down the engine.**

# Abnormal Combustion

Two kinds, both are bad:

 * Detonation: explosive combustion.
 * Pre-ignition: ignition ahead of the spark.

**Detonation**

 * Normal combustion occurs quickly, but smoothly and uniformly. It
   forces the piston down smoothly during the power stroke.
 * Gas temperature increases as it's compressed; if, during compression,
   the temperature of the mixture exceeds a limit, ignition **by the spark**
   count result in the flame moving as much as **25 times its normal
   speed.** This causes large and fluctuating pressure changes in the
   cylinder.
 * This can cause severe damage to pistons, valves, and spark plugs.
   Power will be lost and there's a possibility of complete engine failure.

Signs of detonation:

 * Excessively high Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT), loss in RPM, or
   rough running.
 * Also accompanied by a knocking noise, but can't typically be heard
   from the cockpit.

Causes:

 * Temperature of the fuel air charge entering the cylinder is excessively
   hot. NB. *this can be increased by uneccessary use of carb heat*.
 * Wrong grade of fuel, or time-expired fuel.
 * Over-lean mixture at high power settings.
 * Over-heated engine.

Solutions:

 * Enrich the mixture.
 * Throttle back to reduce cylinder pressures.
 * Increase airspeed to assist cylinder cooling.

**Pre-Ignition**

 * Fuel air charge **ignites before it receives a spark from the plug**.
 * Can be caused by a *hot spot* in the cylinder (eg. lead deposit) which
   ignites the mixture and leads to peak cylinder pressure being developed
   too early in the cycle.

Signs of pre-ignition:

 * Rough running.
 * Possible back-firing.
 * Sudden rise in CHT.
 * Possible engine damage (burnt piston, broken cylinder head, scuffed
   cylinder wall, damage to valves and spark plugs).

Cases:

 * Lead deposits in the cylinder.
 * Using high power with mixture too lean.
 * Overheated spark plugs (possibly as a result of detonation).

**Differences between detonation and pre-ignition.**

Pre-ignition may occur only in one cylinder (eg. where a hot spot
exists), whereas detonation will normally occur in all cylinders.

Pre-ignition is related to the condition of a particular cylinder or
cylinders, where detonation is a function of fuel-air mixture being
supplied to all cylinders.
