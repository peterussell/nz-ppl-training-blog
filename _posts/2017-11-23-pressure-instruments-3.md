# Vertical Speed Indicator

 * Indicates the rate of change of altitude.
 * Based on the fact that pressure decreases with altitude at a known rate (like the
   altimeter), expressed in hundreds of feet per minute (fpm).
 * Also called the **rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI)**, or the **vertical
   velocity indicator (VVI).**

**Operation**

 * A sealed capsule contained in a sealed casing.
 * The inside of the capsule is connected to static atmospheric pressure, and is allowed
   to change almost instantaneously.
 * The casing surrounding the capsule is connected to atmospheric pressure via a
   **metering orifice** which *restricts the rate at which the casing pressure responds
   to any atmopsheric pressure change*.
 * If the aircraft climbs, atmospheric pressure inside the *capsule* will change
   nearly straight away, but the casing surrounding it will change at a slower rate.
 * This difference in pressure rates is measured and displayed as the rate of climb or
   descent.
 * The faster the rate of climb or descent, the greater the pressure differential and
   the higher the reading.

**Lag**

 * Due to this design, there will be some inherent lag in the accurate rate being shown.
 * Advanced VSIs, konwn as **instantaneous VSIs (or IVSIs)** use pitch gyroscopes or
   acceleratometers to reduce or eliminate this lag.

# VSI Errors

 * **Lag** - main cause of error, inherent in the operating principle. The VSI must be
   allowed to settle after aircraft attitude is changed, otherwise it *only indicates
   a trend*.
 * **Position Error** - caused by pressure fluctuations at the static vent, which may
   cause VSI fluctuations even when the aircraft is level, eg. in turbulence.
    * *NB. in light aircraft in turbulence, VSI indications can be misleading and
      the trainee pilot must learn to either ignore them, or learn to average them.*

# Operational Aspects (all instruments)

 * During preflight, don't blow into vents to test them, the instruments can be very
   sensitive.
 * During pre-start checks ASI should read zero (or near zero in strong wind), VSI
   should indicate zero, and set the altimeter setting on the subscale.

**Altimeter Allowable Accuracy**

 * **Within +30 and -45' of aerodrome elevation.**
 * If not, request QNH be checked; if confirmed then altimeter is unservicable.
 * During takeoff run, check **airspeed**, and shortly after entering the climb that
   the **altimeter and VSI indicate a climb.**
 * If not, proceed in the climb to a safe altitude, then as indicated below for
   in-flight failures.

# During Flight

 * Normally the only adjustment required in flight is an amended QNH setting.
 * On rare occassion, blockage of pitot or static vents may occur.
 * If ice blocks the **pitot tube *and drain holes*,** only the ASI will be affected:
    * The pressure in the tube will remain constant;
    * Change in airspeed won't be registered;
    * ASI acts as an altimeter (reduction/increase in static pressure around capsule).
    * If caused by ice, turn on pitot heat if available.
 * If anything blocks the **static vent(s)**:
    * Air will be trapped at the pressure at time of blockage;
    * ASI will show a lower speed than actual during a climb, higher during descent;
    * Altimeter will indicate a constant altitude;
    * VSI will show zero, even though the aircraft may be climbing or descending.
 * **To resolve** - alternate static air (slightly lower pressure in cockpit),
   expect the following indication errors:
    * Difference between total pressure and static pressure will be greater than
      normal, ASI will read high;
    * Static pressure will be lower than normal, altimeter will read higher;
    * VSI may indicate a climb when intially switched to alternate, then settle.
