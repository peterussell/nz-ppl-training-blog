# Vectors and Vector Diagrams

Vectors can be represented as an arrow, where the length indicates the strength
of the vector, and arrowhead represents direction.

Vectors can be added to create a *resultant* vector, and similarly divided to
represent *component* vectors (eg. horizontal and vertical component vectors.)

# Moments and Couples

**A moment is a force about a pivot.** Other terms are torque and leverage. The
strength of a moment is given by the:

 * Product of the force and the perpendicular distance (arm) between its line
   of action and pivot point.

In the SI system, the moment is measured in newton metres (N-m). They may also
be expressed in kilogram-millimetres (kg-mm), particularly in aircraft weight
and balance calculations.

 * *eg. Arm = 3m, Force = 2N, Moment = 6Nm.*

**A couple is two equal but opposite parallel forces.** When they act around
 a point mid-way between the two, a turning force (usually **torque**) is
produced.

The torque is the product of *one* of the forces and the perpendicular
distance between the two forces:

 * *eg. one force = 2N, distance between two forces = 2m, moment (torque) = 4Nm.*

When applied to an object, both moments and couples cause rotation about the
pivot, provided they're not counteracted by moments or couples acting equally
in the opposite direction.

# Equilibrium

Any object in a state of rest or constant velocity is in equilibrium -
the sum of all forces acting on it are zero. It won't accelerate.

An aircraft is in equilibrium when on a constant heading and airspeed, either
level, climbing, or descending. *It is not in equilibrium when turning.*

There are two types: **translational** and **rotational** equilibrium:

 1. Translational
     * Bodies either at rest, or moving in a straight line from one place to
       another at a constant velocity.
 2. Rotational
     * Bodies rotating at a constant rate (usually RPM). The torque in one
       direction is balanced by the torque/load in the opposite direction.

# Newton's Third Law

For every action, these is an equal and opposite reaction.

For example, if you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with an equal
force. Imagine doing it with roller skates on, the harder you push the faster
you move in the opposite direction.

In jet engines, a moving stream (mass) of gases at high-velocity in one
direction achieve thrust in the opposite direction.

# Motion on a Curved Path

Recall that a change in acceleration can be caused by a change in direction at
a constant speed around the circumference.

For an object on a curved path, the direction of its **velocity vector** at
any instant is tangential to the curved path. The turning force and
resulting acceleration are directed along the radius. This is centripetal
force.

Radial acceleration is given by **v<sup>2</sup>/r**. Subsituting this into
F = ma, centripetal force can be calculated by **CPF = mv<sup>2</sup>/r**.

It's usually more convenient to express in terms of weight. We know that
W = m x g. Therefore m = W/g. Finally we get:

**CPF (Centripetal force) = Wv<sup>2</sup>/gr**.

**Applications**

These can be used for calculating force required to turn an aircraft, or
in a vertical plane, eg. pulling out of a dive. Given a constant value for
gravity, we see that for a given radius, as weight or velocity are increased,
the centripetal force generated must also increase.

# Work

Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance. ie.

**work = force x distance moved *in the direction of the force***.

If F is the force, and d is distance moved, then W = Fxd.

**1 joule** of work is done when a force of 1 newton moves an object through
1 metre.

# Power

Power is the rate at which work is done. Measured in Watts in the SI system.

**power = work done / time taken**<br>
**power = force x distance / time**

1 Watt = 1 joule/second.

When referring to engine power, we usually refer to kW.

# Energy

Energy is the capacity to do work, measured in joules. It can be chemical,
mechanical, electrical, etc. When work is done, energy is converted from
one form to another.

 * eg. in an airplane, chemical energy is converted to heat, light, and
   sound energy. Much of the heat energy is then converted into mechanical
   energy to provide thrust.

We are concerned (in this manual) with two types: kinetic and potential.

**Kinetic Energy**

Kinetic Energy is energy due to motion (the capacity to do work due to
motion). Every moving mass has kinetic energy. The amount depends on
mass and velocity.

**kinetic energy = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup>**

 * eg. Piledrivers use kinetic energy to move piles. The larger the mass
   or the faster the acceleration, the more it moves the pile.

Note the square relationship between velocity and kinetic energy, ie.
increasing velocity is the most effective way to increase kinetic energy.

**Potential Energy**

Potential energy is the 'energy of position'. Water at altitude has
gravitational potential energy. An aircraft at altitude also has
gravitational potential energy, which can converted into kinetic energy
and allow it to maintain velocity with little or no power from the engine.
