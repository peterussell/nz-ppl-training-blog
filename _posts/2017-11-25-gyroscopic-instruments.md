# Gyroscopic Instruments

 * Either driven by air passing through a vacuum, or electrically. As a rule, vacuums are
   usually in light aircraft, electrically in more sophisticated.

# Vacuum Systems

 * Consists of an **engine-driven vacuum pump** that *evacuates* (sucks) air from the
   cases of the vacuum instruments. Replacement air is drawn through a fine mesh filter
   then through nozzles which direct high-speed flow at the grooves (or buckets) cut into
   the periphery of the gyro rotors.
 * Gyros spin at high speeds, **often in excess of 20,000 RPM.**
 * After passing through the vacuum pump, air is exhausted to atmosphere.
 * Vacuum pump normally provides suction of **8-10" Hg**, but the instruments oftne require
   less than this -
    * **Relief valves** reduce and control the suction down to about 4.5-6" Hg (green
      range). Some instruments may have additional relief valves for further reduction.
 * With less than the required suction (ie. < ~4.5" Hg), vacuum-driven instruments can be
   unreliable.
 * **A zero reading on the suction gauge, but with no warning light** may indicate failure
   of the gauge. Zero reading *and* a warning light indicates vacuum pump failure.
 * **Suction gauge reading *too high*** - rotors may spin too fast and be damaged,
   instruments may indicate incorrectly.

**Venturi Tube Vacuum System**

Some older aircraft use a venturi tube mounted to the outside of the airframe to provide
suction to gyroscopic instruments.

 * Once the engine is started, the slipstream may provide enough suction to begin to
   spin the rotors, but..
 * Normal gyro indications (due to normal operating speeds) will not generally be
   obtained *until the aircraft has been airborne for a few minutes.*
 * Exposed venturi tube:
    * Creates drag.
    * Is susceptible to icing.
    * Suction generated reduces with increase in altitude due to reduced air density.

# Gyroscopic Instruments

A gyroscope is basically a wheel rotating at high speed. In addition to the *plane of
rotation* it can also have freedom of movement in one or both planes at right angles to
the plane of rotation.

All rotating masses, including gyroscopic rotors, possess two characteristics:

 * **Rigidity in space** - even though the rotors are relatively small, they have high
   mass and rotate at high speed. This gives them **gyroscopic inertia**, meaning they
   tend to maintain their *alignment in space*. This is called rigidity in space.
 * **Precession** - a force applied around the rim of a spinning rotor will tilt the
   rotor *as if the force was applied at 90 degrees further **in the direction of
   rotation.**

The rotors in the instruments are held by one or more pivoting cages called **gimbals**.
These are mounted to use rigidity in space and precession to indicate the attitude,
direction, and rate of turn.

# Turn Coordinator / Turn Indicator

 * Both the modern turn coordinator and older turn indicator use gyros to show
   *rate of turn*, how fast the heading is changing.
 * The **turn coordinator** has a symbolic aircraft representation.
 * The **turn indicator** has a vertical needle.
 * Both include a sliding ball in glass tube - slip/skid indicator.

 * Rate gyroscopes have freedom of movement **only ine on plane** (or axis) other than
   the plane of rotation.
 * Movement about the third axis - the *normal* or vertical axis through the aircraft
   (yaw) causes precession in the rotor, which indicates the rate of turn.
 * The motor is often driven electrically (will be indicated on the face, eg. 'DC').

These instruments represent the turn slightly differently, a *turn coordinator* shows
a tilting aircraft symbol; a *turn indicator* shows a deflected needle (or 'bat').

 * Both instruments have graduation marks, if the needle or wing is aligned with the
   first mark, this is a **standard-rate** (or 'rate 1') turn.
 * **A rate one turn is 3 degrees per second, or 180 degrees per minute / 360 in 2.**
 * Both instruments indicate *rate of turn* and ***not** angle of bank**.

**The turn coordinator indicates roll rate, indicator does not.**

 * Turn coordinator does not indicate pitch attitude.

# The Coordination Ball

 * Indicates *direction of g-forces*, ie. combined effect of earth's gravity, and any
   turning force acting on the aircraft.
 * When the ball is in the middle of the display (between two lines), flight is
   coordinated.
 * If there's any slip or skid, ball moves to one side. Fix by applying rudder pressure
   to the side the ball is one.

**Serviceability Checks of the Turn Coordinator**

 * Check of gyro rotation (whirring sound, no failure flags, correct vacuum if vacuum
   driven, correct amperage/voltage if electrically driven).
 * Correct indications while taxiing (turn right, skidding left, turn left, skidding
   right).
